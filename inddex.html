            HiringMine’s Resume Checker forms its ATS score with a two-tier
            system
          </h1>
          <p>
            When you’re applying for a job, there’s a high chance your resume
            will be screened through an applicant tracking system way before it
            finds its way on a recruiter’s screen. ATS helps hiring managers
            find the right candidates by searching for keywords and adding the
            resume to a database <br> <br>That’s why the success of your resume is highly dependent on how optimized your resume is for the job you’re applying for, the resume template you’re using, and what skills and keywords you have included.

              <h2>The proportion of content we can interpret</h2>
              <p>
              Similar to an ATS, we analyze and attempt to comprehend your resume. The greater our understanding of your resume, the more effectively it aligns with a company’s ATS.

              Although an ATS doesn’t look for spelling mistakes and poorly crafted content, recruitment managers certainly do. The second part of our score is based on the quantifiable achievements you have in your resume and the quality of the written content.
